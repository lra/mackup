"""Mackup.

Keep your application settings in sync.
Copyright (C) 2013-2015 Laurent Raufaste <http://glop.org/>

Usage:
  mackup list
  mackup backup
  mackup restore
  mackup uninstall
  mackup configure
  mackup (-h | --help)
  mackup --version

Options:
  -h --help     Show this screen.
  -f --force    Force every question asked to be answered with "Yes"
  --version     Show version.

Modes of action:
 1. list: display a list of all supported applications.
 2. backup: sync your conf files to your synced storage, use this the 1st time
    you use Mackup. (Note that by default this will sync private keys used by
    OpenSSH and GnuPG.)
 3. restore: link the conf files already in your synced storage on your system,
    use it on any new system you use.
 4. uninstall: reset everything as it was before using Mackup.
 5. configure: Configure what apps Mackup should backup, recommended for
    first-time users.

By default, Mackup syncs all application data (including private keys!) via
Dropbox, but may be configured to exclude applications or use a different
backend with a .mackup.cfg file.

See https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc for more information.

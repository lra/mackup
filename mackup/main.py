"""Mackup.

Keep your application settings in sync.
Copyright (C) 2013-2015 Laurent Raufaste <http://glop.org/>

Usage:
  mackup list
  mackup [options] backup [--all | <app>...]
  mackup [options] restore [--all | <app>...]
  mackup [options] uninstall [--all | <app>...]
  mackup (-h | --help)
  mackup --version

Options:
  -h --help     Show this screen.
  -f --force    Force every question asked to be answered with "Yes".
  -n --dry-run  Show steps without executing.
  -v --verbose  Show additional details.
  --version     Show version.

Modes of action:
 1. list: display a list of all supported applications.
 2. backup: sync your conf files to your synced storage, use this the 1st time
    you use Mackup. (Note that by default this will sync private keys used by
    GnuPG.)
 3. restore: link the conf files already in your synced storage on your system,
    use it on any new system you use.
 4. uninstall: reset everything as it was before using Mackup.

By default, Mackup syncs all application data (except for private keys) via
Dropbox, but may be configured to exclude applications or use a different
backend with a .mackup.cfg file.

See https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc for more information.

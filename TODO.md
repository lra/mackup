# TODO

Feel free to implement any of those ;)

- `mackup status` to display any synced app, and any app that could be synced
    by launching `mackup backup`
- A GUI, we could definitely use an OS X gui that woule display the status:
    synced apps, unsynced apps
- Try with hard links to support the Fonts pb
- Support for DropBox alternatives
- Support for ~/bin (need a custom mode for non 0600 synced files)
- 100% test coverage
- Externalize the applications database as a folder full of json files, one for each app.
- Rollback any file that's not maintained by mackup anymore https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/190

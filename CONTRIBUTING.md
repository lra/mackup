# How to contribute

To speed up the process of getting your PR (Pull Request) approved and merged
into Mackup, make sure you follow those guidelines:
- Keep one application supported per PR
- Add the application you want to support in the list of supported applications
  in the README.md file
- Add yourself a changelog line at the top WIP section of the CHANGELOG.md file
- Don't contribute an application that already provide a way to sync its
  config. e.g. Google Chrome or Alfred (paid version)
- If you want to sync the config of your favorite application, sync only the
  config, not the data. You don't want to have MB of always changing data in
  your syncing folders.

Thanks in advance for your contribution !
